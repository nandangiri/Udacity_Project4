### Sparkify: Predicting Churn for a Music Streaming Service (Sparkify)

### Installations

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Project Motivation
For this project We would be looking at predicting customer churn viz. customer cancellations for a fictional music streaming company nanmely, Sparkify.

### Activities

- Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
- Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes

### Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available here explaining the technical details of my project. A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.88
